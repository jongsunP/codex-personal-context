# Memory Changelog

## 2026-06-12

- Added initial personal context bootstrap structure.
- Established `codex-personal-context` as the source of truth for long-term AI
  collaboration context.
- Documented user profile, AI workflow, development style, decision framework,
  fitness context, vehicle context, and project index.
- Confirmed the current main project is Action Sports Journal.
- Confirmed the user's current vehicle is BMW G30 520d.
- Confirmed the user's preferred AI split: Claude for company development,
  Codex for side projects, ChatGPT for personal questions and coaching.
- Confirmed Action Sports Journal latest local project commit is
  `c7cdfe9 Switch dev analysis server to Gemini video input`.
- Updated Action Sports Journal latest project commit to
  `802bd94 Benchmark OpenAI wakeboard analysis`.
- Recorded that the current priority is an OpenAI GPT-5.5 wakeboard analysis
  benchmark before giving up on OpenAI. The implementation uses whole-video
  frame sampling, Responses API image inputs, xhigh reasoning, and structured
  coaching JSON. Actual GPT-5.5 benchmark still requires a local
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Added the remote continuity rule: when the user asks to check project
  progress or user context, durable findings should be committed and pushed to
  the appropriate Git source of truth rather than left only in local state or
  chat history.
