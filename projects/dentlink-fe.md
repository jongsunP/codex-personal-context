# Dentlink Frontend Coordination

This is the personal cross-repository coordination checkpoint for Dentlink
frontend work. It is not a product repository, combined workspace, or worktree.
Detailed implementation history remains in the relevant existing project file.

## Scope

- Web/Admin repository: `/Users/parkjongsun/Repository/dentlink-client`
- Mobile app repository: `/Users/parkjongsun/Repository/dentlink-app`
- Durable context: `/Users/parkjongsun/Repository/codex-personal-context`
- Active AI workflow: Codex only. The remote `claude-personal-context`
  repository is retained only as an archive and is not loaded by default.

## Session Ownership

- The Dentlink FE top-level session is projectless and owns intake, web/app
  scope classification, shared decisions, priorities, release/deployment
  coordination, handoff prompts, and closeout.
- Sessions are created primarily for a feature or responsibility, not for a
  device or repository. One feature session may inspect and implement both its
  web and app portions across the two product repositories.
- Every code or Git mutation must still name and confirm the exact product
  repository, branch, and worktree. A shared feature scope does not combine Git
  histories or permit writing from an ambiguous directory.
- The top-level session may directly implement a small, clearly scoped change.
  Split out repository-specific or parallel sessions only when scope, runtime,
  ownership, or collision risk justifies it.
- Keep one active writing session per worktree. Repository main-checkout
  sessions are optional helpers for branch/worktree/release administration,
  not permanent web-versus-app session boundaries.
- Shared repository mutations still require the user's explicit authorization.

## Context Routing

- Read `projects/dentlink-client-order-feedback.md` and other matching
  `dentlink-client` checkpoints for web/Admin implementation history.
- Read `projects/dentlink-app.md` for app implementation, runtime, build, and
  deployment history.
- Read `projects/dentlink-unified-notification-center.md` when that cross-web/app
  feature resumes.
- Keep repository-specific branch, commit, QA, and blocker detail in those
  existing files. Record only cross-repository decisions and coordination
  state here.

## Transition Checkpoint — 2026-09-11

- The DL-15828 web-only session was closed, its dedicated worktree and local
  task branches were removed, and web follow-up moved to the main
  `dentlink-client` checkout. Its verified state is recorded in
  `projects/dentlink-client-order-feedback.md`.
- Live verification found the main `dentlink-client` checkout clean on
  `release/v1.86.0` at `0e0878ef1`, synchronized with its remote. Its only
  local branches are `master` at `ddeeb1e86` and `release/v1.86.0`, both at
  0/0 divergence, and its only registered worktree is the main checkout.
- The app-specific session completed its live Git, PR, Jira, validation and
  delivery audit on 2026-09-11. Its final handoff is recorded in
  `projects/dentlink-app.md`; the product repository remained unchanged during
  the handoff and personal context was the only authorized write target.
- The local `claude-personal-context` checkout was removed after confirming it
  had no local-only changes, commits, stash, or worktrees. Its GitHub repository
  remains available for optional future recovery.

## Top-Level Session Start

1. Pull `codex-personal-context` and read the common guidance plus this file.
2. Read the relevant web and app checkpoints before relying on prior chat.
3. Fetch/pull both product repositories only as required by the current task,
   then verify exact path, branch, HEAD, upstream, dirty state, and worktree.
4. Classify each new request as web, app, or shared before deciding the owning
   implementation session and release target.
5. Do not create a worktree for a very small change without first asking the
   user, and do not reuse a completed feature branch.
6. Reconcile Jira, Notion, Figma, Swagger, and live code when the new request
   depends on them; do not re-fetch every external source without a task-driven
   reason.

## Next Starting Point

- On 2026-09-11 the user delivered the prepared prompts to both the new
  projectless Dentlink FE top-level session and the existing app session.
- After prompt delivery, the user clarified that future sessions are organized
  by feature rather than by device or repository. The current rule in this
  checkpoint supersedes earlier prompt wording that implied web and app
  implementation sessions should be split by default.
- This former `dentlink-client` management session can now close. Its repository
  cleanup and cross-repository operating-rule migration are complete.
- The web and app session handoffs are complete. The new projectless Dentlink
  FE top-level session should pull `codex-personal-context` again and use the
  repository-specific project files as its starting evidence.
- For app work, first re-fetch `/Users/parkjongsun/Repository/dentlink-app` and
  verify PR #286, Jira, branch and runtime state. The preserved app starting
  point is `feature/DL-16061` at `a8f3a6c`; resume implementation only for a
  new QA card, reviewer finding, or confirmed product/API/design change.
- The top-level session accepted the app handoff and rechecked live state.
  The earlier transition handoffs came from the former web session;
  `DENTLINK_APP_FINAL_HANDOFF` came from the former app session. Keep their
  repository ownership distinct. Ask the user when a substantive conflict or
  unanswered decision remains after comparing the evidence.
  After the 15:07 handoff, PR #286 was merged into app `develop` at 15:09:46
  KST. Its squash result exactly preserves the feature tree. Detailed Git and
  review evidence is in the latest section of `projects/dentlink-app.md`.
- Keep current delivery gates separate: app implementation and develop
  integration are complete; DL-16229 and DL-16353 remain `READY FOR QA`.
  No formal human approval is recorded, and release/Production inclusion is
  not confirmed. Preserve existing branch/worktree state until the user asks
  for cleanup; do not reuse the completed feature branch for new work.

- On 2026-09-11 the existing unified-notification-center session aligned its
  role beneath this top-level session, retaining one web/app feature scope.
  It remains in planning with no assigned implementation branch or release;
  detailed decisions and verified state stay in
  `projects/dentlink-unified-notification-center.md`.

## E2E Coordination Checkpoint — 2026-09-11

- Detailed current state is in `projects/dentlink-client-e2e.md`. The dedicated
  worktree is `/Users/parkjongsun/Repository/dentlink-client-e2e`, branch
  `feature/e2e-reliability`, HEAD `0e0878ef1`; 30 changed/new files remain
  uncommitted. Product commit/push/PR/deployment have not been authorized or done.
- Scope is web with supporting Clinic/Lab/Admin flows, including feedback;
  native app E2E is excluded. The objective is role-neutral, trustworthy full
  staging verification within the registered coverage, without a fixed pass count.
- After the earlier defect-fix closeout, the user required implementable operating
  integration to be completed. Official local/staging/deployed-dev/headed commands
  and all three CI workflows now use one runner for collection, version/source
  evidence, verdict and per-run artifacts. Focused/UI diagnostic evidence is
  separated from full staging verification.
- Retained regression checks now pass **100/100**, including lifecycle ownership,
  signup transition, false-success prevention, interruption/owned-process cleanup
  and source-rename detection. Independent review findings were resolved. Type,
  formatting and diff checks passed.
- Official local full passed **104 + 5 allowed exclusions**, with all 109 results
  accounted for and clean teardown. This precedes only the final source-digest
  rename correction. The correction passed its real-Git regression and the
  subsequent final staging full run; exact source versions are in the E2E file.
- Final official staging full passed **104 + 5 allowed exclusions**, with no
  failure/flaky/extra nonexecution/global errors. Final source digest is
  `6b8a0e35265a09fbc54d19aba51e1ecf0bf784abe95bb37b5f8ee255d0fbd75f`;
  Clinic/Lab/Admin BUILD_IDs stayed stable at the execution boundaries. Both
  environments' onboarding meta/locks and owned local server listeners were absent
  after completion.
- The prior deferred implementation/verification items are complete. Remaining
  delivery gates are explicitly authorized product Git/PR integration and actual
  remote CI execution. The new workflows have not run remotely. Use the official
  runner for future evidence; do not require the old temporary wrapper or repeat
  the same matrix merely to accumulate passes.
